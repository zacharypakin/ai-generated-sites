            <h2>Self-Care</h2>
            <p>I believe that it's important to take care of yourself, both physically and mentally. I make sure to get
                enough sleep, eat healthy foods, and exercise regularly. I also try to spend time doing things that I
                enjoy, such as reading, writing, and spending time in nature.</p>
